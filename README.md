# CSGO-cfg
This is my Counter-Strike : Global Offensive autoexec config.

An autoexec.cfg file is used to guarenttee that your personal settings for the game CS:GO (Counter Strike : Global Offensive) will always be set when you launch the game.  An autoexec can be useful if you have or play on multiple computers by keeping your settings the same across all computers.  

### How to Use an Autoexec
First you need to add `.cfg` file named `autoexec` in your CS:GO cfg folder.  This folder can be found at:
        
        ...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg

Next need to set CS:GO's launch options to execute your autoexec.cfg every time you load the game.

To set your launch options your need to:
        
        > open steam  
        > open your games library 
        > find and right-click Counter Strike : Global Offensive in your games library
        > left-click properties 
        > left-click 'Set Launch Options...'
        > Then add "+exec autoexec" (without quotes) and click OK
